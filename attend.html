    The webinars will be accessible either via Zoom or via a dedicated youtube channel.<br />
    In order to access via Zoom you will need to be registered, you can do this <a href="https://forms.iit.it/embed.php?id=296602">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    We recently added the possibility to submit an abstract for a flash talk, which somehow replaces the traditional poster presentation.
    <br />
    If you already registered only as an Attendee, you can always register again and submit an abstract, for a regular or a flash talk.
    </p>
    <p>
    The webinars will be followed by Q&A and by a discussion. <br />
    Those who are watching the event streamed on youtube will be able to ask written questions on the youtube chat, once authenticated with their youtube account. <br />
    In order to make oral questions, or to participate to the discussion, you will need to be logged on Zoom, and therefore to be registered.
