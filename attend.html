                The webinars will be accessible either via Zoom or via a dedicated youtube channel.<br />
                In order to access via Zoom you will need to be registered, you can do this <a href="https://forms.iit.it/embed.php?id=296602">here</a>.<br />

                We recently added the possibility to submit an abstract for a flash talk, which somehow replaces the traditional poster presentation.
                <br />
                If you already registered only as an Attendee, you can always register again and submit an abstract, for a regular or a flash talk.
                </p>
                <p>
                The webinars will be followed by Q&A and by a discussion. <br />
                Those who are watching the event streamed on youtube will be able to ask written questions on the youtube chat, once authenticated with their youtube account. <br />
                In order to make oral questions, or to participate to the discussion, you will need to be logged on Zoom, and therefore to be registered.
                </p>
                <p>For those who won’t be able to attend the Webinars, most of them will be recorded and put on the Protein Electrostatics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1U5rrVjxa7PUVA7ODyjVfQ">Youtube channel</a>. <br />
                   In case of technical problems that would require changing the the youtube link for the webinars, you will be able to find the updated link on this website.</p>
